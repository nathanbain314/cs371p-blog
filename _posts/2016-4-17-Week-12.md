title: Week 12

###April 11 through 15###
###Past week ###
On Monday we got the project description for the final project. My partner and I started working on it early and managed to get all of the basics of the code working. We still need to get the handle class working and add the begin and end functions, but hopefully we can finish it early enough. I've written a few cellular automata programs before, so I thought that might be helpful, but in reality these functions are so simple that there is really no issue in understanding the problem. In lecture we spent time learning more about classes, virtual methods, and abstract classes. 

###Challenges###
I've had difficulty managing my time for this past week. I have three projects that I want to do well on that require a large amount of work. I've been working hard on them and have spent almost all of my free time on them, but I've ended up working on each one almost exclusively for a day or two, leaving me unprepared for the other projects and over prepared on the current project.

###Next week###
Next week I need to finish up the life program. I would like to get it done early so that I can avoid as much stress as possible. I've turned in the last two projects less than hour before they were due, which is uncomfortable.

###Tip of the week###
I don't really have any tip since I haven't had the time to think of one, but while reading more about Conway's Life I found this picture of a simple glider. I think it is pretty calming to look at, knowing that it is “moving” using a few simple rules, just slowing and simply traveling forever.
