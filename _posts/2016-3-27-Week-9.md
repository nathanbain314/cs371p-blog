title: Week 9
---

###March 21 through 25###
###Past week ###
On Monday we went over iterators and started learning about constant values and constant pointers, as well as how to and when to use them. We continued learning about constants on Wednesday and then moved onto arrays, and focused on arrays of different types. My partner and I had already written most of the functions for the project and only needed to finish up the valid() function and get all of the unit tests working. We managed to get all of the project working and all of the tests passing and submitted the project on time.

###Challenges###
 I had three group projects due on Thursday night, so I had to find time to meet up with all of them and work on the projects. I was able to find time for them throughout the week, but on Thursday they all came together and I had to split up my time between them all. One was due at midnight, so I mostly worked on that one after the other two were due. 

###Next week###
Next week I will begin working on the Darwin project. This project looks like it will take more time than the last project, so Iâ€™m going try to start early. 

###Tip of the week###
[Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) is an open source graphing software that allows you to generate graphs visualizing structures in networks, machines, and web design.
